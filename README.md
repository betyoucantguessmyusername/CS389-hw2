## Server/Client Testing

Despite the prompt's claim that we should be able to make our old tests work fine with the new interface, we had to significantly gut our tests in order to make them work in the new context. The network interface doesn't allow user-input hashers or evictors to work properly, so we couldn't do that; since Eitan removed memset from the list of things we could send to the server, the client can't know the server's maxmem, so we couldn't test even the built-in evictor; it's impossible to call destroy_cache without shutting up the server, so we couldn't run any tests which needed to clean up their own memory rather than just having caches passed into them; et cetera. Overall, while we remained able to test basic functionality (set, get, delete, collision handling), we couldn't get nearly the same quality of testing that we could when the cache was stored locally.
